# Piston
So this simulation works independently as a physics simulation by mimicking the motion of a motor and converting it into a linear motion on cartesian plain which can be visualized in the animated graph


initial values required:

+Radius of motor arm

+Length of the arm connected

+Interval after data is recorded(in angles)
